#This example:
#- Starts at 100°C for the first 30 seconds
#- Ramps to 150°C between 65-90 seconds
#- Maintains 200°C from 90-110 seconds
#- Cools down gradually to 100°C at 320 seconds
#- Finishes cooling to 10°C by 500 seconds (full profile duration)
#- Allows time adjustments in 60-second increments
